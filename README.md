Sample application

For the rest of this tutorial, we will be working with a simple todo list manager that is running in Node.js. If you’re not familiar with Node.js, don’t worry. No real JavaScript experience is needed.

At this point, your development team is quite small and you’re simply building an app to prove out your MVP (minimum viable product). You want to show how it works and what it’s capable of doing without needing to think about how it will work for a large team, multiple developers, etc.
